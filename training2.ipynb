This research highlights the experiences of adults with ADHD.

In addition,\\nbecoming aware of the stigma associated with ADHD can help clinicians improve upon individual treatment plans to\\nmeet their patient’s needs. It is important to note that this sample experienced co-morbid diagnoses and so this may limit\\nthe interpretation of the ﬁndings.

However,\\na review of the literature as well as longitudinal studies\\nof individuals with ADHD reveals that symptoms\\nof ADHD can persist into adulthood (Faraone et al.\\n2006; Davidson, 2008). Regardless of this literature,\\nthere is limited evidence of the unmet needs and\\nexperiences of adults with ADHD (Matheson et al.\\n2013). It is common among adults with ADHD to\\nexperience high rates of co-morbidities; three in four\\npatients have at least one or more co-morbid psychia-\\ntric disorder (Faraone & Biederman, 1998). In some\\ncases, these other psychiatric disorders can dominate\\nthe picture, causing symptoms of ADHD to be over-\\nlooked or even undiagnosed. Therefore, individuals\\nwith ADHD can be under-treated and may fail to\\nreceive a diagnosis of ADHD and sufﬁcient treatment\\nwhich can result in life-long challenges and difﬁculties.\\nResearch has shown that adults with ADHD often\\ncomplain of psychological and psychosocial difﬁculties\\nwhich can impair functioning, well-being, and health-\\nrelated quality of life in adulthood (Nigg et al. 2002;\\nMurphy & Adler, 2004; Adler et al. 2006; Weiss et al.\\n2010). Compared with adults without ADHD, adults\\nwith ADHD have a higher risk of developing depres-\\nsion, anxiety, substance abuse, anti-social behaviours,\\nlowered socio-economic status due to work-related\\nstress (Faraone et al. 2000; Schubiner et al. 2000; Barkley\\net al. 2004; Wilens & Dodson, 2004), social skills deﬁ-\\nciencies due to difﬁculties in affect recognition (Rapport\\net al. 2002), increased anger expression (Richards et al.\\n2006), are more likely to commit anti-social acts and\\nbe arrested (Barkley et al. 2004), and an increased risk\\nfor motor vehicle accidents (Swensen et al. 2003).\\nADHD can have a negative impact on ﬁnances, career\\nopportunities,\\nincome,\\nretirement\\nfunds\\n(due\\nto\\nimpulsive spending), friendships groups, families and\\nco-workers (Brod et al. 2012).', '2000; Schubiner et al. 2000; Barkley\\net al. 2004; Wilens & Dodson, 2004), social skills deﬁ-\\nciencies due to difﬁculties in affect recognition (Rapport\\net al. 2002), increased anger expression (Richards et al.\\n2006), are more likely to commit anti-social acts and\\nbe arrested (Barkley et al. 2004), and an increased risk\\nfor motor vehicle accidents (Swensen et al. 2003).\\nADHD can have a negative impact on ﬁnances, career\\nopportunities,\\nincome,\\nretirement\\nfunds\\n(due\\nto\\nimpulsive spending), friendships groups, families and\\nco-workers (Brod et al. 2012).

Without treatment, these impairments\\ncan have detrimental effects on quality of life.\\nStigma is an underlining difﬁculty faced by many\\npeople suffering from mental illness, ADHD in parti-\\ncular. Previous research has noted some individuals\\ndemonstrate hesitance and reluctance to engage and\\ninteract socially with their fellow peers experiencing\\nthe disorder. One such study was carried out in an\\nAmerican University. This study consisted of under-\\ngraduate students rating the likelihood that they would\\nrather interact with a peer described as having ADHD,\\na peer with general medical problem, or a peer with an\\nambiguous ﬂaw such as perfectionism (Canu et al.\\n2008). Peers described as having ADHD were rated less\\nsocially desirable than peers with the other two\\ndescriptions. It is unclear as to whether stigma stems\\nfrom a lack of awareness of ADHD or popular myths\\nabout the illness in that it is only restricted to childhood.\\nAs reasons remain unclear, researchers have requested\\nfor further research to examine the stigma associated\\nwith adults with ADHD (Lebowitz, 2013).\\nA signiﬁcant amount of the available literature on\\nadults with ADHD has used samples from the United\\nStates and the United Kingdom, and researchers have\\nrequested further research with various methodologies\\nto shed light on the experience of ADHD in adulthood\\n(Lebowitz, 2013). Therefore, this research seeks to\\nexplore the experiences of adults with ADHD from a\\nclinical sample in Western Ireland. The rationale of\\nthis study is simple; understanding the impairments\\nassociated with ADHD in adulthood and the stigma\\nattached to this illness can help practitioners be more\\naware of the difﬁculties faced by individuals accessing\\nsupport services and possible barriers that may affect\\ntreatment adherence, particularly within a Western\\nIrish context. Previous research among individuals\\nwith\\nADHD\\nhave\\nmostly\\nemployed\\nquantitative\\napproaches (Young, 2005; McCarthy et al. 2013). How-\\never, qualitative approaches are more appropriate at\\nproviding an in-depth insight into patients’ experiences\\n(Pope & Mays, 1995). Like any illness or disability, early\\nintervention can improve quality of life, self-esteem,\\noverall functioning, outcome and long-term prognosis\\n(Agarwal et al. 2012; Shaw et al. 2012; Harpin et al. 2013;\\nMatheson et al. 2013). Therefore, this research is\\nessential to ensuring timely and early support is\\navailable to those who require it. There is very little\\nunderstanding of the perspectives of adults with\\nADHD reported in the scientiﬁc literature (Young et al.\\n2008; Henry & Hill Jones, 2011), particularly regarding\\nthose with untreated ADHD. Therefore, it is hoped that\\nthis research study will contribute to the literature by\\ninforming clinicians of the lived experiences of adults\\nwith ADHD.\\nAims of the study\\nThe aims of the study were twofold: to examine the\\nfunctional impairments of ADHD and to investigate\\nperceived attitudes and stigma.\\nMethod\\nMethodological approach\\nA qualitative approach using semi-structured inter-\\nviews was used as it aims to elicit a detailed and in-\\ndepth description of the participants’ experiences and\\nviews. A literature review was carried out to establish\\ntopics to guide the interview in order to elicit com-\\nmentary in several areas, including daily life, social,\\npsychological,\\nand\\nphysical\\nfunctioning,\\nnegative\\neffects of ADHD, positive effects of ADHD, experiences\\naccessing\\nsupport\\nservices/treatment\\ncentres\\nand\\nattitudes towards ADHD. Demographic information of\\neach participant was recorded in order to generate\\ndescriptive statistics.\\nRecruitment\\nThe recruited sample was a sub-sample of a larger\\nepidemiological study (Adamis et al. 2016). Consecutive\\npatients attending any Adult Mental Health Services\\nout-patient clinics of Sligo/Leitrim were invited to\\nparticipate. Participants completed the Adult ADHD\\nSelf-Report Scale and the Wender Utah Rating Scale.\\nExclusion criteria applied were as follows: age less than\\n18 or above 65, illiterate, non-English speaking patients.\\nThose who scored positive in both scales were further\\nassessed (second stage of the initial study) with the\\nConners’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV\\n(CAADID) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric\\nInterview (M.I.N.I.) (Sheehan et al. 1998) for diagnosis of\\nco-morbid disorders.', 'Recruitment\\nThe recruited sample was a sub-sample of a larger\\nepidemiological study (Adamis et al. 2016).

So it’s that kind of thing that\\nstopped me. You know I would have loved to have gone\\non and maybe go back to college or do something but\\nthat kept me away’ (2), ‘I could never hold a job down.\\nI would always lose focus of the job or I just wouldn’t be\\nbothered just doing the same stuff over and over again\\nand I always found it very mundane.

Participants descri-\\nbed how they felt like they failed to fulﬁl their potential,\\nyet knowing they are capable of doing more: ‘I’m not\\ndoing the work as well as I should be because I know that\\nI can work very well. If I don’t, I’m automatically seen\\nby other people as poor performance so then I would\\nbe putting myself under more pressure to get the\\nwork done … deﬁnitely procrastination is a big thing\\nfor me’ (9). Again, participants reﬂected upon their\\nchildhood and how undiagnosed symptoms may have\\nlimited their educational opportunities from an early age:\\n‘I spent half of my time in the corridor, outside of the\\nclassroom. One half in the corridor and the other half in\\nthe principal’s ofﬁce’ (4), ‘I would have to really really\\nlearn things and then they were gone. And that used to\\nupset me and I couldn’t understand. Things would go in\\nwhen I learned it and then that night it was gone …\\nI suppose things just got harder, to retain all of the\\ninformation’ (2).\\nPerceived positive and negative effects of ADHD\\nEvery cloud has a silver lining\\nSome participants noted the beneﬁts of some of the\\nsymptoms experienced. ‘I kind of like being like that at the\\nsame time as well. Doing things on impulse is always\\nbetter rather than stuff that you plan out, it never works’\\n(4). ADHD could perhaps contribute to a fulﬁlled and\\nexciting life ‘kind of deﬁnes me as a person I suppose …\\njust the impulsiveness to go and do something that\\nsomebody else wouldn’t have done’ (4). One participant\\nnoted the advantages of having an overactive mind,\\nlooking to the bright side of being easily distracted.\\n‘I suppose sometimes it is useful (being easily distracted),\\nif I’m stuck in my own head a bit too much and I’m just\\nover thinking things and stuff like that, it’s deﬁnitely a\\ngood thing to be able to let your mind wander a bit, not\\nto think about anything too heavy’ (6). It was suggested\\nthat being impulsive and unpredictable can make a person\\nmore likeable. ‘Maybe the spontaneous aspect, people\\nseem to enjoy that’ (8).\\nLow self-conﬁdence and self-esteem\\nA lot of participants reported psychosocial effects of\\nsymptoms of ADHD. For example, some participants\\nreported lack of self-conﬁdence and self-esteem pre-\\nvented them from taking part in new experiences: ‘I get\\nfrustrated a lot of how I lack in college work, I would\\njust be very easily distracted and then just lower self-\\nesteem. Like it can happen before I go to do something\\nand then getting frustrated during. Before I start\\nsomething I think what’s the point, I can’t do that\\nanyways’ (6). Negative comparisons to others affected\\nmaking new friends: ‘I suppose I would have been\\na little less inclined to get to know people … I felt\\nlike everybody was way ahead of me anyways’ (6).\\nConﬁdence appeared to limit possibilities in terms of\\nemployment prospects: ‘I never stuck at anything …\\nthen I guess I have no conﬁdence either. I never thought\\nI would be able to do it … I wouldn’t go for a job or\\nI would never try for things’ (3), and functioning at\\nwork ‘I know I should be doing it quicker and I can do it\\nquicker’ (5).', 'Like it can happen before I go to do something\\nand then getting frustrated during.

I never thought\\nI would be able to do it … I wouldn’t go for a job or\\nI would never try for things’ (3), and functioning at\\nwork ‘I know I should be doing it quicker and I can do it\\nquicker’ (5). Low self-conﬁdence and self-esteem had\\nseveral consequences during childhood, causing frus-\\ntration and embarrassment compared with peers: ‘I get\\nfrustrated because everyone else can do it and I can’t\\nand I get frustrated out of that’ (11), ‘It made me a bit\\nnervous, I realised that they were remembering and\\nI wasn’t’ (2).\\nCoping\\nA sense of disorganisation was evident throughout\\nthe interviews which was considered debilitating and\\ndraining. ‘I get distracted with work or that and just\\ngetting frustrated and feeling like I can’t do it and I get\\ndown on myself that I’m not good enough so it’s just\\nlike being distracted and also just feeling like I can’t do\\nit anymore, getting frustrated and giving up. So I deﬁ-\\nnitely struggle with that kind of thing’ (6), ‘I do pro-\\ncrastinate, again that would be quite typical because\\njobs often seem very big and overwhelming’ (7). The\\nimpression from interviews was that daily tasks, such\\nas household chores, clothes washing, packing a bag,\\nmaking breakfast can appear impossible and over-\\nwhelming. ‘When I wake up in the morning, just the\\nthought of having to do all of that, I mightn’t bother\\ndoing that … because that time in the morning when\\nI’m just after waking up, any series of tasks like that\\ncomplicated would be insurmountable, I would want\\nanother half an hour just staring there beforehand’ (9).\\nStrategies were employed to overcome these chal-\\nlenges. ‘One trick that I try to teach myself in general\\nwas what I’ve learned from mental health tools is to try\\nand do the next little thing and not think of all\\nthe things that I have to do.

Going to\\nhospital and attending the psychiatric services were\\nconsidered the most severe and unwanted forms of\\ntreatment. ‘Well I would say I had a huge resistance to\\nPsychiatry … because to me that was another downhill\\nstep … as long as I didn’t go to a Psychiatrist that meant\\nI was ok. And then at that point, it was as long as\\nI haven’t been institutionalised’ (7), ‘They (my family)\\ncan’t really handle mental health issues. Like if I had\\ncancer, it would be ok’ (7). The majority of participants\\ndiscussed what they thought ADHD was and con-\\nfessed that they believed it to be restricted to childhood.\\n‘When I heard of ADHD I used to always think it\\nwas hyperness … I thought it was just a childhood\\nthing’ (2), ‘I often heard about it (ADHD) in kids really\\nmore so than adults. The impression I got is that it\\nwould be kids just throwing tantrums … I always\\nthought it was unruly kids’ (5), ‘People question is\\nADHD made up, is it an excuse for boldness’ (9).\\nADHD is viewed in a negative light, and stigma\\nattached to the disorder may arise from character\\nportrayals in the media. ‘the bad character in that had\\nADHD so it’s not seen in a positive light. It might not be\\na positive thing’ (8).\\nDiscussion\\nADHD is typically regarded as a childhood disorder\\nwith little attention given to adults with ADHD,\\nwho often go unnoticed and undiagnosed. The scarce\\nliterature\\nthat\\nis\\navailable\\nemploys\\nquantitative\\nmethods;\\ntherefore\\nthis\\nqualitative\\nmethodology\\nprovides further insight into ADHD in adulthood. The\\nmain aim of this research was to the experience of\\nassociated with ADHD in adulthood, as well as the\\nperceived stigma attached to the disorder. This research\\nhighlights the difﬁculties and challenges faced by an\\nIrish clinical population who have remained undiag-\\nnosed until adulthood.\\nThe perceived burden and sense of impairment\\nassociated with ADHD symptoms was highlighted\\npersistently\\nthrough\\nthe\\ninterviews\\nis\\nin-keeping\\nwith\\nprevious\\nresearch\\nin\\nthis\\narea,\\nsuggesting\\nthat symptoms of ADHD persist into adulthood. The\\nnegative effects of the symptoms were quite dominant\\nthroughout the interviews, however there were some\\npositive effects associated with symptoms of ADHD.\\nSome of the participants viewed their impulsivity in a\\npositive light and felt it made them more likeable to\\nothers, whereas others noted how impulsivity affected\\ntheir work, social life and completing daily tasks such\\nas household chores.\\nParticipants in this research often felt and identiﬁed\\nthemselves as different to other people. This difference\\nwas noticed retrospectively in childhood, while in\\neducation, and highlighted when in relationships.\\nThe ﬁndings suggest that symptoms of ADHD such as\\ninattention,\\npoor\\nconcentration,\\nhyperactivity\\nand\\nimpulsivity may have affected the participants’ ability\\nto remain focused in school making the earlier years an\\nunpleasant period which increased the likelihood\\nof falling behind their peers resulting in reduced self-\\nesteem and self-conﬁdence. This in turn may have\\nresulted in the feeling of missed opportunities and\\nfailing to fulﬁl potential.\\nStigmatisation was explicitly recognised as an issue\\nthat the general public and clinicians need to be aware\\nof. There was a huge under awareness of the disorder,\\nparticularly the fact that it can persist into adulthood.\\nADHD is viewed in a negative light with one participant\\nmaking reference to a popular TV show portraying a\\n‘bad’ character with ADHD implying it makes children\\nuncontrollable. This stigma may have implications during\\nthe diagnostic process. Clinicians need to be aware\\nof the stigma associated with the disorder and thus can\\nmaintain the appropriate sensitivity.', 'This in turn may have\\nresulted in the feeling of missed opportunities and\\nfailing to fulﬁl potential.\\nStigmatisation was explicitly recognised as an issue\\nthat the general public and clinicians need to be aware\\nof.

However, it is important to note that\\nparticipants had not yet received a formal diagnosis.\\nTherefore, this may affect the ﬁndings in that indivi-\\nduals may not have recognised their symptoms of\\nADHD and thus the impact they may have had on their\\nlife. As outlined, all of the participants had at least\\none co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis and therefore the\\nexperiences described above could be due to other\\ndiagnoses. In addition, due to preliminary research\\nwith this cohort, researchers were aware of history\\nand information about other co-morbid psychiatric\\ndisorders and this may have affected the results in that\\nit may have been difﬁcult to determine the effects of\\nADHD versus those of other disorders.\\nConclusion\\nThis research highlights the experiences of adults with\\nADHD. It is important for clinicians and practitioners\\nto be aware of the perceived positive and negative\\neffects of the disorder, and how it can impact on their\\npatient’s lives. In addition, becoming aware of the\\nstigma associated with ADHD can help clinicians\\nimprove upon individual treatment plans to meet\\ntheir patient’s needs. Further research in this area\\nshould explore patient’s attitudes towards receiving\\na formal diagnosis including perspectives linked with\\na delayed diagnosis or delayed treatment. Following\\ntheir formal diagnosis, a follow-up interview would be\\ninteresting to decipher the experience of receiving a\\ndiagnosis in adulthood.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe would like to thank the participants in this study.\\nFinancial Support\\nNo funding was received to conduct this research.\\nConﬂicts of Interest\\nThe authors declare that there are no conﬂicts of interest\\nto disclose.\\nEthical Standards\\nThe authors assert that all procedures contributing\\nto this work comply with the ethical standards of\\nthe relevant national and institutional committee on\\nhuman experimentation with the Helsinki Declaration\\nof 1975, as revised in 2008.
